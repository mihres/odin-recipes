    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the coarsly chopped smoked meat overnight in a pot of water.
            After soaking the meat overnight add fresh water and cook the meat for 30 minutes,
            after cooking strain it and set it aside</li>
        <br>
        <li>Wash and strain the rice,
            add the oil along with finely chopped onion to a pan to brown the onion,
            add the rice to the pan and cook for 2-5 minutes until the rice soaks up the oil.
            Set aside to cool down.
            <br>
            In a pot add the mince meat, 2 tbsp of salt 1/2 tbsp of pepper (or to taste),
            parsley, egg, finely chopped garlic, along with the cooled down rice.
            Thoroughly mix all ingredients, cover and let it rest for an hour.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Separate the leaves from the pickled cabbage and wash them individually,
            make sure not to break or damage the leaves (try to get similarly sized leaves, for consistency)</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a pot, place a layer (of the larger cabbage leaves) on the bottom,
            you can also chop the cabbage and place it instaed of the leaf.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place a leaf (root side towards you) on the surface you are working on.
            Take about 1/2 a cup of the meat mixture shape it into an oblong ball,
            then place it on the leaf, fold the sides in and roll it (like a wrap or a burrito).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place 1 layer of the rolls into the pot followed by the the (cooked) smoked meat,
            add another layer of chopped cabbage along with the bay leaf.
            The remaining layers will all be rolls. After you have used up all the meat and layered it in the pot,
            place the remaining (chopped) cabbage leaves on top (add 2-3 tbsp canned tomatoes).
            Add enough water to the pot to cover the top layer</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cover the pot, place on high heat and bring to boil, then place on low heat and let it cook for 2-3 hours.
            Make sure that the top layer is always covered with water, and occasionally just lightly shake the pot.</li>
        <br>
        <h4>Roux (browned flour):</h4>
        <li>Once the Sarma is finished cooking, place 1 tbsp of paprika, 2 tbsp of plain flour and 2 tbsp of oil in a
            pan,
            mix and cook until brown, then thin it down with a few tbsp of the soup from the pot and mix it well.
            Once it is mixed pour it back into the pot of Sarma shake the pot to mix it all together and cook it for
            another 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <br>
    </ol>
    <p>Serve with fresh bread and mashed potatoes.
        <br>
        Keep it in the fridge for up to a week (or freeze it if there is
        any left). The longer it sits the tastier it is.
