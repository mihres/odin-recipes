    <h2>Cherry Jelly Pudding</h2>
    <p>A light and refreshing cake of my own creation</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 jar of cherries (670 g)</li>
        <li>1 pack of sponge fingers</li>
        <li>1-2 packs of strawberry or raspberry jelly</li>
        <li>1-2 packs of vanilla pudding (Dr. Oetker brand or similar)</li>
        <br>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Strain the cherries and set them aside</li>
        <br>
        <li>Take the sponge fingers, dip them in the cherry juice lay them out in a single layer in a cake pan,
            try to have as little gaps as possible (square pan works best).
            If theres is any left over juice pour it over the sponge fingers and let them soak it up</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make the pudding and pour it over the sponge cake (depending on the size of the cake pan,
            you might need 2 packs). Ensure the sponge fingers are completely covered by the pudding.
            Let the pudding set for a few hours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make the jelly and let it cool down a bit (don't let it set).
            Again, depending on the size of your cake pan you might need 2 packs.
            once the jelly is no longer hot pour it over the pudding and place some of the strained cherries
            (or all of them) into the jelly (make sure the jelly is completely covering the cherries.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Put the cake in the fridge and let the jelly set.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Slice and serve</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>ENJOY!</h3>
